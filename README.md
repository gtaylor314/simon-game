# Simon the Game...Kind of.
This website lets you play a modified version of the short-term memory game Simon. Instead of showing you a complete pattern to remember and replicate each time, this version of Simon shows you one piece of the pattern each level. In order to progress, you must remember the pattern from level 1 to your current level, replicating the entire pattern each time. For example, say level 1 flashes the yellow button, you press the yellow button and level 2 flashes the green button. You must now press the yellow button and then the green button to go on to level 3 and so on.
